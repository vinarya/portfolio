## Introduction

**MD-UAV Lite** is an improved, smaller, and more reliable version of the original MD-UAV hybrid VTOL concept developed at the University of Michigan. After identifying structural and vibration challenges in the inherited full-scale MD-UAV airframe, this aircraft was created to serve as a **clean-sheet test platform** that preserved the mission goals—rapid deployment of medical supplies—while enabling more dependable testing, control integration, and manufacturability.

The aircraft was designed around a **2 kg payload capacity** and an operational range of approximately **10 km**, with the ability to perform **VTOL**, **STOL**, or conventional runway operations depending on the mission.

## Project Motivation and Goals

The primary objective of MD-UAV Lite was to convert the complex and vibration-sensitive MD-UAV concept into a platform that was:

- structurally robust
- easier to tune on PX4/ArduPilot
- simpler to manufacture and repair
- small enough for rapid iteration
- capable of validating hybrid-VTOL control strategies

This lighter airframe helped isolate core VTOL performance parameters before reintegrating them into future full-scale vehicles.

## Airframe Design and Materials

MD-UAV Lite was built using a combination of **EPO foam**, **carbon-fiber reinforcement**, and **3D-printed components** for housings, mounts, and structural interfaces. This hybrid approach struck a balance between weight, cost, and structural rigidity while allowing rapid redesigns.

Key design drivers included:

- minimizing vibration for clean IMU signals
- strengthening wing and fuselage interfaces
- ensuring clean separation between VTOL rotors and control surfaces
- creating accessible internal bays for avionics and batteries

The final structure offered enough stiffness for stable VTOL hover yet remained light enough for efficient forward flight.

## Structural Development and Validation

The structural design followed an iterative workflow supported by **CAD modeling** and **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**. These simulations helped size spars, reinforce high-load regions, and evaluate deflection during VTOL operations.

After simulation, physical **test rigs** and lightweight spars were added to verify:

- fuselage rigidity
- wing bending behavior
- structural integrity during VTOL thrust conditions
- adequate safety factor under cruise loads

This combination of virtual and physical testing ensured the aircraft performed reliably in all configurations.

## Avionics and Power System Integration

MD-UAV Lite used a **Pixhawk flight controller** as the core of the avionics stack. The internal layout was designed to ensure:

- clean wiring routes
- separation between noisy and sensitive components
- easy access to the battery bay
- low-vibration mounting points for the flight controller

Once avionics integration was complete, individual motors and ESCs were bench-tested before full system run-ups were performed.

## Flight Testing and Control Tuning

With the structure and avionics validated, MD-UAV Lite proceeded to flight testing. Tuning focused on improving responsiveness and stability in three flight regimes:

### **Vertical Flight (Hover)**

- PID tuning for precise attitude control
- Noise filtering to ensure stable IMU readings
- Validation of thrust-to-weight ratios

### **Forward Flight**

- tuning of pitch/roll authority
- validating airspeed sensor performance
- testing efficiency at different throttle settings

### **Transition Between Modes**

- mapping throttle and tilt-mixer behavior
- ensuring smooth handoff between control models
- incremental transition attempts to refine parameters

These tests provided practical insight into hybrid-VTOL behavior and also validated Pixhawk’s mode-switching logic for future models.

## Conclusion and Future Work

MD-UAV Lite successfully demonstrated a compact, structurally robust, and controllable hybrid VTOL aircraft tailored for medical supply delivery missions. By resolving many of the issues present in the larger MD-UAV airframe, it served as a reliable stepping stone toward future hybrid designs and informed the direction of later platforms—including **Kestrel Mini**, which embraced a simpler, no-moving-parts philosophy.

Future work includes refining transition tuning, improving battery utilization, and completing expanded flight tests under varied environmental conditions.
