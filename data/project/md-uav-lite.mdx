# Introduction
The MDUAV SP 23 is a versatile, multi-role aircraft designed for the rapid deployment of medical supplies. As the Lead Engineer, I was responsible for the overall design, performance calculations, and control system setup. The aircraft is capable of carrying a 2kg payload over a range of 10 km and offers multiple take-off and landing configurations.

# Objectives
Develop a VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft for rapid medical supply deployment.
Achieve a payload capacity of 2kg and an operational range of 10 km.
Create a multi-role aircraft capable of VTOL, STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing), and conventional take-offs and landings.

## Avionics
Integrated a Pixhawk as the primary flight controller.
Successfully mounted avionics and completed motor tests.
Conducted a Motor Runup in preparation for flight testing.

## Testing
Conducted comprehensive flight tests to evaluate the aircraft's responsiveness in various modes:
<ul>
 <li>Vertical Mode: PID tuning for stable vertical take-offs and landings.</li>
 <li>Horizontal Mode: PID tuning for efficient and stable horizontal flight.</li>
 <li>Transition Mode: PID tuning for seamless transitions between vertical and horizontal flight.</li>
</ul>

## Control System
Played a pivotal role in setting up the control systems for vertical, horizontal, and transition modes.
Utilized PID controllers for fine-tuning the aircraft's responsiveness in each mode.
