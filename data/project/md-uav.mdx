## Introduction

**MD-UAV** (Medical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was a research initiative within the University of Michigan’s Aerospace Engineering Department, conducted under the guidance of **Dr. Anthony Waas**. The goal was to develop a **tiltrotor VTOL aircraft** capable of delivering medical supplies to remote or infrastructure-limited regions.

I joined the project as the new lead in Summer 2021, inheriting a partially built tiltrotor airframe from the previous team. What followed was a comprehensive re-evaluation of the design—structurally, aerodynamically, and mechanically—to determine what could be salvaged, what required redesign, and what lessons could shape future UAV platforms.

## Assessment of the Inherited Design

Upon taking over the project, it became clear that the existing airframe suffered from significant structural and integration issues. The carbon-fiber spars had been attached in a way that introduced **excessive vibration**, which in turn made the aircraft nearly impossible to tune on PX4 or ArduPilot, especially given its large rotor diameter and overall size.

Additionally:

- The **tiltrotor mechanism** exhibited reliability concerns.
- Several subsystems lacked proper documentation and traceability.
- Component sizing and structural assumptions required verification.
- The partially built frame limited redesign options without major rework.

Rather than forcing the aircraft to fly in an unsafe configuration, I began a systematic investigation of propulsion, aerodynamics, stability, and firmware tuning behavior to understand the limits of the inherited design.

## Aerodynamic and Structural Reevaluation

To reassess the aircraft’s viability, I re-performed key trade studies and simulations using **OpenVSP**, **FlightStream**, and **STAR-CCM+**. These tools helped evaluate:

- pressure distribution across the wings
- rotor–wing aerodynamic interference
- hover-to-cruise transition loads
- structural deflection under VTOL thrust
- overall aerodynamic efficiency

The studies confirmed several issues with the original configuration and identified areas where redesign was necessary. They also provided a clearer foundation for future hybrid VTOL concepts within the project.

## Propulsion System Testing

A major portion of the reevaluation involved conducting **dynamic thrust tests** in the **University of Michigan’s 5×7 ft wind tunnel**. These tests provided accurate data on:

- thrust behavior under varying inflow conditions
- rotor performance during transition speeds
- power loading at different disk angles
- whether a forward-flight pusher motor was required

The wind tunnel data ultimately informed our cruise and maximum velocity estimates, while also exposing limitations of the tiltrotor setup at higher advance ratios.

## Firmware Tuning and Vibration Issues

Much of the project’s engineering time went into **tuning PX4 and ArduPilot** for such a large hybrid VTOL platform. The goal was to stabilize hover, reduce oscillations, and prepare the aircraft for untethered transition tests.

However, the inherited airframe’s **high vibration levels** caused severe sensor noise, preventing:

- stable attitude estimation
- reliable motor mixing
- EKF convergence
- proper PID tuning

  />
</div>

This experience pushed me into a deep exploration of:

- filter tuning (IMU filtering, notch filters, low-pass settings)
- control loop structure in PX4
- encoder tracking for tilt-mechanisms
- power system noise isolation
- firmware-level motor output testing

These lessons later shaped my design philosophy for **Kestrel Mini** and subsequent UAVs: avoid moving parts wherever possible.

## Transition to MD-UAV Lite

Through months of simulation, structural analysis, manufacturing assessment, and propulsion testing, it became clear that significant aspects of the inherited airframe could not be brought to a reliable flight state.

However, the **components, data, and lessons learned** were instrumental in shaping a new aircraft: **MD-UAV Lite**.

This successor model was:

- smaller, lighter, and easier to manufacture
- built around **rigid, vibration-resistant geometries**
- redesigned for better component placement
- structured around simpler, more dependable VTOL principles

MD-UAV Lite—and later, **Kestrel Mini**—represented the distilled outcome of everything learned through the larger MD-UAV aircrat.

## Collaborators

MD-UAV was developed in collaboration with:

- **BlueFlite**, a commercial VTOL drone manufacturer
- **KNUST, Ghana**, for operational relevance in remote medical logistics
- Faculty and student teams within the **Composite Structures Lab**

These partnerships helped shape the long-term goals of the program and provided insight into the practical challenges of deploying VTOL aircraft for medical outreach.

## Conclusion

MD-UAV served as an important transitional project: a chance to critically evaluate a large hybrid VTOL airframe, identify its structural and aerodynamic shortcomings, and build the experimental knowledge that informed more mature UAV platforms.

The project provided deep experience in **wind tunnel testing, firmware tuning, structural redesign, and hybrid-VTOL system analysis**, ultimately shaping the more successful and reliable designs that followed.
