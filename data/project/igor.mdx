Igor is an all terrain vehicle that can seat two people. It's equipped
with caterpillar tracks driven by two 125cc engines, making it perfect
for off-road exploration. It uses a Raspberry Pi and a slew of high torque
servos in order to allow for remote operation via a 2.5 GHz remote
controller making it an ideal choice for being deployed in hostile regions.

The caterpillar's tracks are made with off-the-shelf motorcycle chains
linked together with rubber connections. To keep the tracks straight,
sprockets are used to rotate the drive train and suspension. The engines
on either side alter their throttle based on input from the driver to turn.
This system allows you to change direction of Igor while standing still,
giving it an unrivalled turning radius.

The suspension of Igor allows the track to change shape in accordance with
the terrain. The suspension arms resemble "dog legs" and include shock
absorbers to soften the ride while keeping the track slack free.

Igor was built over the course of 9 months and uses aluminium and stainless
steel for light and rugged construction. The onboard driver or the remote
controller sends signals to the Raspberry Pi, which translates them into
throttle and brake response for the engines and brakes.
