was designed for the AUVSI competition, where the objective was to fly over a designated area, identify
ground targets, and accurately drop payloads onto these targets from a height of 100 feet. The payloads
were 16 oz water bottles, and the more accurately we could deliver these, the higher our score would
be.

# Role and Contributions:

As the Structures Lead for the MAT-4 aircraft, I was responsible for designing the aircraft from scratch. One of the major challenges was to design it in such a way that it could carry the maximum amount of payload without exceeding the FAA's 55 lbs weight limit for UAVs.

I also designed a unique payload delivery vehicle. It was 18 inches in length and 3 inches in diameter, with a parachute housing mechanism that would deploy at a certain height, as measured by a barometric sensor. This design was not only innovative but also less complex and power-intensive compared to what other teams were doing.

Moreover, it was my idea to place the payloads right under the wing, inside the fuselage to maintain the center of gravity, which required a tail dragger landing gear configuration. This ensured that the aircraft's stability wouldn't change with each subsequent payload drop.

# Impact: Our aircraft was the only one among the three M-Fly teams that was able to fly at the end of
the year. The payload drop and delivery worked as expected, demonstrating the effectiveness of the design
and the successful collaboration of multidisciplinary teams.
