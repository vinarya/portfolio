Kestrel Mini is a **tandem-wing tailsitter VTOL UAV** developed as a lightweight research aircraft for studying **aerodynamic stability, transition flight, and efficient eVTOL design**. Featuring a fully **3D-printed modular airframe** and a **gull/inverted-gull wing configuration**, the aircraft serves as a practical platform for validating design choices through both **simulation** and **real flight testing**.

This project ultimately supported the results presented in my thesis, which includes **OpenVSP and VSPAero trade studies**, structural analysis, and empirical testing.

## Project Overview

Kestrel Mini was created to answer a key research question:

> **_Can a small, mechanically simple VTOL aircraft achieve stable hover, smooth transition, and efficient forward flight using geometry alone—without tilting rotors or control surfaces?_**

To explore this, I developed a compact UAV that integrates:

- **Tandem-wing layout** for improved lift distribution
- **Gull + inverted-gull geometry** for natural stability
- **Four-motor differential-thrust control**
- **Modular 3D-printed structure** for rapid iteration
- **Custom aerodynamic tuning using OpenVSP/VSPAero**

## Design Goals

The primary goals of the Kestrel Mini project were to:

### **✔ Develop a compact tailsitter UAV for research**

The aircraft needed to be easy to build, inexpensive to repair, and flexible enough for rapid testing.

### **✔ Study aerodynamic stability using OpenVSP/VSPAero**

Trade studies were used to analyze pitching moment, lift distribution, wing incidence, motor placement, and stall characteristics.

### **✔ Validate the design through real flight testing**

The platform functions as a bridge between simulation, prototype fabrication, and flight validation.

## Aerodynamic Analysis (OpenVSP & VSPAero)

Before fabrication, I performed a series of aerodynamic trade studies using **OpenVSP** and **VSPAero**.  
These simulations helped optimize the geometry and predicted how the UAV would behave in forward flight and transition.

### **Key Aerodynamic Findings**

- A **+4° front wing incidence** produced a stable nose-down restoring moment.
- The **front wing stalls first**, improving passive pitch recovery during transition.
- The **gull + inverted-gull angles** acted like a **V-tail**, improving roll and yaw damping.
- Vertical motor placement did **not reduce control authority** in hover, enabling true multi-plane wing layouts.
- Tandem wings improved static margin and CG flexibility, making the aircraft easier to balance.

These findings directly influenced the final printed design and reduced the number of physical iterations required.

## Airframe Design & Construction

Kestrel Mini is built entirely from **modular 3D-printed PETG components** with carbon-fiber spars for reinforcement.  
The interlocking design allows **tool-less assembly**, fast repairs, and easy swapping of wing sets for aerodynamic testing.

### **Design Features**

- Fully 3D-printed fuselage, wings, and fairings
- Carbon-fiber spars for stiffness
- No glue or fasteners (except motor screws)
- Interchangeable modules for quick iteration
- Average airframe cost: **under $50**

## Hardware & Flight Controller Setup

**Propulsion**

- **4 × 2207 – 1800 KV motors**
- **5 × 3** tri-blade propellers
- **1300 - 2200 mAh 6S LiPo**

**Electronics**

- STM32-based flight controller running **Betaflight**
- Custom **tailsitter mixer configuration**
- Two PID profiles: one for hover, one for forward flight
- Differential thrust for all attitude control

This setup allowed clean hover performance and smooth transitions without requiring servos or tilt mechanisms.

## Flight Testing & Validation

Kestrel Mini underwent indoor and outdoor test flights to compare real behavior with simulation predictions.

### **Hover Flight**

- Stable hover at ~26% throttle
- Minimal torque twist due to the X-frame gull-wing structure
- Clean response to manual inputs

### **Transition to Forward Flight**

- Smooth 90° pitch-over in ~2–4 seconds
- < 2 meters of altitude loss
- Passive pitch stability matched VSPAero predictions

### **Forward Flight**

- Lower power consumption than hover
- Stable cruise with minimal pilot input
- Strong roll/yaw damping from the gull-wing geometry

## Project Impact

Kestrel Mini became the foundation for:

- larger Kestrel UAVs (3 kg, 10 kg, etc.)
- tandem-wing VTOL aircraft research
- my thesis work on geometric stability
- wildfire-suppression payload studies
- next-generation medical delivery UAV concepts

It demonstrated that **geometry-driven stability** can replace complex mechanical systems in VTOL aircraft.

## Future Work

Planned improvements include:

- Autonomous transitions using Ardupilot/Pixhawk
- Higher-aspect-ratio wings for extended range
- Modular payload bays
- Improved control laws for transition flight
- Migrating the platform to a standardized research testbed

## Conclusion

Kestrel Mini is a highly capable, low-cost research UAV that bridges simulation and real-world validation.  
Through aerodynamic analysis, modular design, and extensive flight testing, the aircraft proved that a **tandem-wing tailsitter** can achieve stable hover, smooth transitions, and efficient forward flight using only **fixed-pitch rotors** and **geometric stability**.
