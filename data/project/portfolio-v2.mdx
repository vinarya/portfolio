# Introduction

My previous [portfolio website](https://vinamrarya.com/v2) serves as a digital resume and a showcase of my diverse skill set. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website was 
designed to be both visually appealing and functionally robust. It features a clean, modern layout with intuitive navigation, making it easy for 
visitors to find what they're looking for.

# Key Features

- **Home Page** _(index.html)_: This is where you'll get to know a bit about me right off the bat, along with quick navigation options to dive deeper 
into other sections of my portfolio.

- **Project Pages** _(e.g., ceo-burnoulli.html, cricket.html, flying.html etc.)_: I've dedicated individual pages to each of my projects or roles. These 
pages offer detailed descriptions and, in some cases, visual elements to help you understand the scope and impact of my work.

- **Skills and Interests** _(e.g., fpv.html, garber.html, igor.html etc.)_:  I wanted to give you a rounded view of who I am, both professionally and 
personally. These pages delve into my skills and hobbies, from coding to flying drones.

- **Academic and Professional Roles** _(e.g., research-assistant.html, regional-secretary.html etc.)_: Here, you'll find insights into my academic and 
professional journey. I've detailed the roles I've held and the contributions I've made in each.

- **Styling** _(assets/css/styles.css)_: I've used custom CSS to give my website a unique and personalized look. I wanted the design to be a reflection
of my style and personality.

- **Interactivity** _(assets/js/app.js)_: To enhance your experience, I've added interactive elements using JavaScript. Whether it's a hover effect or 
a dynamic content load, I've tried to make the website as engaging as possible.

# Technical Details
- **HTML:** I used HTML to structure the content, ensuring each section is organized and easy to navigate.
- **CSS:** The custom styles are all located in a single CSS file, making it easier for me to manage the layout and design.
- **JavaScript:** I've used JavaScript to add a layer of interactivity, making the website not just informative but also engaging.

# Conclusion
I'm really proud of how my portfolio website turned out. It's a well-crafted, comprehensive platform that effectively showcases my skills, projects, 
and interests. I believe it serves as an excellent tool for networking and job searching, offering a detailed look into both my professional and personal life.
