# Overview

[Glimpz](https://glimpz-it.com/dashboard/home) is the flagship product of [Audion Technologies](https://audiontec.com/), a startup co-founded by myself and my friend [Dhruv Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvtiwari7). Designed to revolutionize the way you discover music, Glimpz is an app that seamlessly integrates with your Spotify account to offer personalized song recommendations.

# How It Works
Once connected to your Spotify account, Glimpz curates a list of song snippets based on your existing playlists. Each recommendation is a 30-second snippet, giving you just enough to decide whether the song resonates with you. You have the option to either like or ignore these snippets. Liked songs are automatically added to your Spotify playlist, making it effortless to expand your musical horizons.

# Technical Details
<ul>
    <li>Frontend: I took the lead in designing the UI/UX of the app, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience for the users. The frontend code is primarily written in React.</li>

    <li>Backend: I also contributed to the backend development, which is hosted on AWS. This robust infrastructure ensures that the app runs smoothly and can handle a large number of users.</li>
</ul>
# The Vision
Our goal with Glimpz is to make music discovery as personalized and effortless as possible. We believe that music is a deeply personal experience, and Glimpz aims to make that experience even richer.
