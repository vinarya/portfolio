# Introduction

Since a alot of model aircrafts can be prohibitively expensive in India due
to import duties and limited scale of manufacturing airplanes in India, I
wanted to offer a product that would be affordable for a beginner and easy
to repair in case of crashes.

Little Tornado is one of the first offerings from my startup Burnoulli Tech.
It's a model aircraft that I designed myself. There are two variants of
Little Tornado: high wing and low wing. The high wing variant is easier to
fly and ideal for beginners. The low wing variant is sportier and geared
towards more intermediate flyers. I designed Little Tornado as an easy to
assemble and fly aircraft for students and enthusiasts who are just starting
out with aeromodelling. It has four channels and is powered by a 2200 mAh
11.1V battery.
