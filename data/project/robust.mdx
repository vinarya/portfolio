Robust is a remote-controlled robotic platform. It contains a similar
number of degrees of freedom as a human arm and can rotate 360 degrees.
Robust was constructed out of balsa wood and controlled with a 16 Channel
remote in order to participate in the science fair. However, independently
operating each servo for the arm proved to be time consuming and fussy.
To solve this problem, I utilized Arduino Mega to reduce the number of
channels required to operate Robust from 16 to 7.

Now with just 7 channels, you can control all of the robot's functions
including its gripper, elbow, shoulder, base rotation and drive motors
making it much easier to operate than before. Also, the second iteration
of Robust uses 3D printed parts to keep it light weight while enhancing
its structural strength.
