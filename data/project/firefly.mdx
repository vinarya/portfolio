FireFly is a fire fighting hexacopter that uses a raspberry pi and a flight control
board to look for heat signatures corresponding to fire. It then flies towards it and
dispenses fire retardant from an off the shelf fire extinguisher. Its payload bay can
be used to house several types of fire extinguishers, allowing it to extinguish various
types of fires such as type A,B,C,D. Moreover, FireFly has a First Person View (FPV)
camera to help the operator control the aircraft accurately even when its not in the
line of sight.

I first got the idea for FireFly when I read a news article about the damage California
wild fires cause and the difficulties the firemen face while trying to get them under
control. Moreover FireFly can be of great help while fighting fires in high rise building
where it would be impractical to use a ladder and too time consuming and dangerous to use
stairs.

The idea is simple, use a drone with a heat sensor and an extinguisher to put out the fire.
But the execution is not so simple. One of the biggest challenges was integrating Ardupilot
(flight control software), running on the flight controller, with Raspberry Pi for full
autonomous flight.
