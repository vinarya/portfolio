SpyRo is an all terrain UGV platform with four caterpillar tracks. Each of these caterpillar tracks can
change orientation independently giving SpyRo the ability to tackle any terrain while keeping a low profile.
I built the first prototype in middle school and kept refining the design to obtain the current version
Mk. 4. The most recent refinement was made during my sophomore year of college and includes an on-board
computer (Rapsberry Pi) for autonomous navigation as a 3D printed chassis in order to reduce weight while
increasing rigidity. I have put SpyRo through its paces in various environments, from grassy fields to
snow-covered slopes, and it has performed admirably in all situations.
