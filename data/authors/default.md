Hello there, I am Vinamr.

Born and brought up in India, I am currently enrolled in the University of Michigan pursuing Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. I love to solve problems and build things. Creativity, innovation, and collaboration are some of the key values that guide me. I have experience leading teams and working on projects. In my free time, I like to watch documentaries, work model airplanes, and play cricket.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have a project or an idea that you think I can help with, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and feel free to browse around and get to know me better!
