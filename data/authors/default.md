Hey there, I’m Vinamr.

Born and brought up in India, I’m currently based out of Arizona. My work, as an Assistant Researcher at Arizona State University, focuses on designing and building advanced Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, especially for medical delivery, wildfire response, and missions in remote or infrastructure-limited regions. I enjoy working at the intersection of creativity, engineering, and real-world problem-solving, and I’m always looking for ways to turn ambitious ideas into practical, working systems.

Over the years, I’ve led teams and contributed to a range of projects — from lightweight prototype aircraft to larger tandem-wing platforms and emerging concepts for autonomous wildfire-suppression drones. I love the challenge of taking a concept from a rough sketch to a flying machine and refining it until it’s both elegant and reliable.
Outside of work, I’m happiest when I’m outdoors. I love going on hikes, road trips, and exploring new places in general. I occasionally play the violin, and when it comes to sports, I enjoy watching both cricket and football.

I’m always open to interesting collaborations or new ideas. If you think there’s something we could build or explore together, feel free to reach out. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
